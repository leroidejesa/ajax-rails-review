### Local Setup
*(requires Postgres)*

1. Clone Repo `$ git clone https://github.com/leroidejesa/rails-portfolio-v0.0.2.git`

2. Setup Gems `$ bundle install`

3. Create/Seed Database `$ rake db:setup`

4. Run PostgreSQL `$ postgres`

#### Known Bugs / Future Additions
* Site doesn't auto-scroll down past top section on several pages
* Text area in posts/comments doesn't yet allow formatting
* 'Forgot your password?' link doesn't really work. 
* Admin authentication is implemented manually -- would like to try a gem in the future.
* CSS needs to be refactored in Sass. Not DRY at all
